Noxim - the NoC Simulator
=========================

To compile all the other (optional) tools, just type "make".

apsra2noxim
-----------
- Extracts communication and routing tables from the APSRA generated output file

direction_test
--------------
- Contains all the connections and directions related to the switchBloc (butterfly architecture)

distancebased_ttable
--------------------
- Creates traffic tables with a specified amount of short/long range communications

hotspot_ttable
--------------
- Creates traffic tables to simulate traffic among nodes of mesh regions

mapping2cg
----------
- Converts a communication trace to a mapped communication trace

mapping_core2switch
-------------------
- Contains the mapping between cores and switch in butterfly architecture

mapping_sw2sw
-------------
- Contains the mapping between swithes all over stages in butterfly architecture

noxim_explorer
--------------
- Explores each configuration of the design space generated by spacefilegen and exports results in matlab format

ttable_distance_calculator
--------------------------
- Determines short/long range wired communications (and their percentage) of a given traffic table

ttable_from_hub
---------------
Generates a traffic table with node to node communications starting from a traffic table with hub to hub communications
