Noxim - the NoC Simulator
=========================

Installation instructions
-------------------------

This guide will show you how to install Noxim on your computer.

IMPORTANT:

If you have not tried yet, use the automatic installation script found on the Noxim homepage and
just skip all the instructions below.


Supported Platforms
-------------------

Noxim is written using the C++ language and the SystemC library, so it is easily portable to
any platform for which SystemC is supported: please refer to their (SystemC) documentation to
know which they are. Just to let you know, we usually work under GNU/Linux (mainly Ubuntu)
but SystemC is known to run under other platforms including Apple Mac OS X and Sun Solaris
with GCC and Microsoft Windows with Visual C++ (but Cygwin with GCC is also known to work).

On latest Windows version, you may try also the Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL).

This document will then detail the steps required to build Noxim from the sources, including
all prerequisites.


PREREQUISITES: C++ compiler, YAML (with Boost Libraries), SystemC

C++ compiler installation
----------------------------------
To compile SystemC you will obviously need a C++ compiler; if you still don't have it, on
 Debian/Ubuntu platforms you may install all the required tools with the following command:

   sudo apt-get install build-essential

YAML installation
----------------------------------
The name of the package depends on the Unix version you are using.

On Ubuntu 14.04, for example, it is possible to install yaml (and the required boost 
libraries) with:

    sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev libboost-dev

    If the packet libyaml-cpp-dev is not available just build yaml-cpp:
    Prerequisites:
    - CMake
        sudo apt-get install cmake

    - Boost libs
        sudo apt-get install libboost-dev

    Then download the code at https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/archive/master.zip
    and execute the folloqing commands: 

        unzip yaml-cpp-master.zip
        mv yaml-cpp-master yaml-cpp
        cd yaml-cpp
        mkdir lib
        cd lib
        cmake ..
        make
        sudo make install


On MacOSX, when using macports, just type:

    sudo port install yaml-cpp

Please also set properly the YAML path in the Makefile, as follows:
YAML    := /opt/local/

SystemC installation
----------------------------------

- Download SystemC (currently at version 2.3.1) from:

http://www.accellera.org/images/downloads/standards/systemc/systemc-2.3.1.tgz

- Unpack it:
    tar -xzf systemc-2.3.1.tgz

- Enter the newly created directory and refer to the file INSTALL which details all the steps
  required for building. Basically they are:

    mkdir objdir
    cd objdir
    export CXX=g++
    ../configure
    make
    make install
    cd ..
    rm -rf objdir

  Once you have installed SystemC correctly, you may then jump to the next step.


Build Noxim
-------------

If SystemC is installed correctly, then you just have to compile Noxim.

1) Extract the source files and go to the "bin" directory.

2) In that directory edit the file Makefile to modify "SYSTEMC" and "YAML" 
environment variables according to your installation paths. Please, note that the
values already set in the Makefile should be fine if you are using Ubuntu  

3) Just run "make".

You may ignore warning messages (if any), so if you don't get any error you are
ready to run Noxim for the first time using the command:

    ./noxim

If everything works fine, it is now safe for you to copy or move this executable
elsewhere; if you are a maniac of cleaning please note that "make clean" will
also delete the executable... so move it before cleaning!

That's all, folks!
