#Simple test file for testing delta with wireless
#TEST 2:
# core 0 and switch 10 are connected to hub0
# switch 17 and core 1 are connected to hub1
#
# How things should work (with winoc_dst_hops >=1):
# 0->1: via wireless hub0->hub1
# 0->2/3: via wireless hub0->hub1 with relay 17, then ->2/3
# 4/5->1: wired until sw 10, then wireless hub0-hub1 to reach 1
# 4/5->2/3: wired until sw 10, then wireless hub0-hub1 with relay 17 to reach 2/3
