#Simple test file for testing delta with wireless
#TEST 16:
# core 0 and 7 are connected to hub0
# switch 42 in the last stage in connected to hub1
# switch 38 previous the last stage in connected to hub2
#
# How things should work (with winoc_dst_hops):

# 0->4/5: via wireless hub0->hub1 with relay 42, then ->2/3
# 0->12-15: wireless hub0-hub1 with relay 38, ONLY if winoc_dst_hops>1
